## Overview

**Pathy** is an app that keeps track of a user’s route during a walk, run, bike ride, or other outdoor activity. It leverages Apple’s CoreLocation framework to request and monitor the user’s location, then visualizes the resulting path. Over several stages, you will:

- Prompt users for location permission (and handle access states correctly).
- Continuously track location to gather a route.
- Visualize that route on a map in real time.
- Persist route data on a backend (create, read, delete).
- Display additional route details, like addresses for start and end points.

## Main Learning Objectives


1. **Delegate Pattern**  
   Uses the delegate pattern extensively (with `CoreLocationManager`, among others).

2. **System Frameworks**  
   Integrates Apple’s built-in frameworks (e.g. CoreLocation, MapKit).

3. **Networking & Async Code**  
   Making async network calls to a backend, including GET, POST, and DELETE requests.

4. **UI/UX Best Practices**  
   Building a polished, user-friendly interface. Follows design specs from Figma.
